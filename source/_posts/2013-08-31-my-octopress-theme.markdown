After setup my blog site with fancy octopress, and trying out several octopress themes listed in [opthemes](http://opthemes.com), I started tune my own theme based on the those great themes. 

So here is [my theme](https://github.com/wgui1/Octopress-Theme-Wgui), based on DarkStripes. 

1. tune a little bit on article layout, remove timestamp, add tags in article footer

2. remove ender.js, and use jquery that I am more comfortable with

3. integrate [MagnificPopup](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/) to show great picture popup.
