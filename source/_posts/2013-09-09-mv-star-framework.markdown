Read some MV* framework recently, like [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/#introduction), [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/), [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/).

[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) is quite a good place to go to look at all those frameworks.

Personally, I like [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/#introduction) in the first time. It follow javascript unobtrusive style, and its concepts are easy to understand. Even though it may need more bolierplate code compared with others like Ember.js, Angular.js.

[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) are great, but the learn curve are more steep than Backbone.js. 

There are also discussion on [Ember and Angular](http://www.quora.com/Client-side-MVC/Is-Angular-js-or-Ember-js-the-better-choice-for-Javascript-frameworks)
